# Two_Sum
Anthony Licea
the two sum problem asks to return the indices of two values in an array of integers which add to a desired/ given value. The code listed here provides two ways of solving the problem. two_sum.java is the brute force implementation while two_sum_pointer is the two pointer sliding window implementation.
